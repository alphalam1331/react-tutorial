### **Installation**

- Using create-react-app
    - `npx create-react-app APP_NAME` or `npx create-react-app APP_NAME --template typescript`
    - `yarn create react-app APP_NAME` or `yarn create react-app APP_NAME --template typescript`
- Using Vite
    - `npm create vite@latest` (interactive mode)
    - `npm create vite@latest APP_NAME -- --template react-ts`(Direct mode)
    - `yarn create vite` (interactive mode)
    - `yarn create vite APP_NAME --template react-ts` (Direct mode)
    - `pnpm create vite` (interactive mode)
    - `pnpm create vite APP_NAME -- --template react-ts` (Direct mode)


### **Start the React app**


1. Change the working directory (don't forget to install the packages for the first time)
    - `cd APP_NAME`
    - `npm i` or `yarn install` or `pnpm i`  

2. Run the server
    - `npm start` or `yarn start` or `pnpm start`
    - `npm run dev` or `yarn dev` or `pnpm dev`

**go to http://localhost:3000 you should see a rotating react logo**

### **File structure**

Inside the root directory, you may see the react app boilerplate had already been set up for you,
then go further to the src/ directory where you may see: 

1. main.tsx/main.jsx is the entry point of the application. 
2. App.tsx/App.jsx provides you an example of react component, change some code and see what happens!
3. It would be better to manage your files in multiple, hierarchial folders for having a organised file structure. There are many ways to do it, you are free to find yours, but, as the official said, don't spend more than 5mins on it.

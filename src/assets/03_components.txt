### **Components**
1. Components are independent and reusable resources. Once you have written a component snippet and exported it, you can place it anywhere (by importing it like a module).
2. Components can be the building blocks of pages, but itself can also be a stand-alone page without importing any other components (like App.tsx or App.jsx)
3. You can nest components inside components to construct a complex structure.

In React, a component can either be class component or function component.
Function component is going more popular than class component, so it's what we are going to learn in this tutorial.

As mentioned, App.tsx (or App.jsx) is an example of react components. If you open the file, you can see a function named App which returns something syntactically similar to HTML elements.

### **JavaScript XML (JSX)**

That's JSX.

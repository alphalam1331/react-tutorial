### **Components**
Components are independent and reusable in the sense that once you have written a component snippet and exported it, you can place it anywhere.
Components, in other words, are like modules, act as the building blocks of a page, but itself can be a page. like App.tsx/App.jsx

In React, a component can either be class component or function component.
Function component is going popular than class component, so it's what we are going to learn in this tutorial.

As mentioned, App.tsx/App.jsx is an example of components. If you open the file, you will see a function named App which return something unusual.
